## Hands-on Labs in the Afternoon

Serverless meets OpenShift Virtualization â€“ a powerful combination for the efficient deployment and management of cloud resources.  
Participation is free. All you need to bring is your laptop. The labs require an internet browser and direct internet access.  

### Serverless with bespinian

Together, we play through the ten levels of writing and deploying serverless applications. Each level represents a new challenge that teams who decide to go serverless usually face. The goal of this tech lab is that we can work our way through these challenges and caveats so that you don't have to face them in your own applications anymore. By doing so, we'll apply best practices, debug and harden your serverless applications based on AWS Lambda and other serverless technologies.

### OpenShift Virtualization with tim&koko

In this half-day workshop, you'll first receive a theoretical introduction to the fundamentals of OpenShift Virtualization. Then, you'll apply what you've learned directly in hands-on labs. Our experts will guide you step by step so that you can experience the key concepts and features in practice. You will deploy, start, stop, scale, live migrate, configure VMs on an OpenShift cluster, and much more.
