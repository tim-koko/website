With our extensive experience in traditional virtualization and Kubernetes, we help companies seamlessly modernize and successfully migrate workloads. Additionally, we offer specialized [training]({{< ref "blog/2024-kubevirt-training" >}}) to prepare your team for the future. This package helps you quickly explore the possibilities of Kubernetes-based virtualization and assess the potential for a new or parallel strategy.

### Description

The **OpenShift Virtualization Accelerator Package** accelerates customers' adoption of Kubernetes-based virtualization. After the accelerator package, customers will have:

* **A custom virtualization strategy** aligned with your business goals and ready to drive operational efficiency.
* **A Skilled, Enabled Team** with hands-on experience in OpenShift Virtualization, prepared to manage and expand your Kubernetes-based virtualization independently.
* **A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Environment** built and tested, providing a secure playground for ongoing experimentation and training.
* **A Clear Migration Roadmap** identifying priority workloads and a structured approach for smooth, impactful migration.
**Improved Resource Utilization and Cost Savings** with an optimized platform that supports container and VM workloads.
* **An Alternative** to Broadcom with Kubernetes-based virtualization, enabling flexibility and independence from proprietary solutions.

&nbsp;

### Phase 1 - Discovery

Gain a comprehensive understanding of the customerâ€™s current setup, processes, and goals to align OpenShift Virtualization with their business strategy.

* **Current Setup Assessment**: This involves analyzing the existing infrastructure, covering aspects like compute, network, and storage. It also involves reviewing current virtualization environments and any on-prem or cloud setups.
* **People and Process Review**: Assess how teams, processes, and methodologies interact with current technology. Identify roles, workflows, and any bottlenecks or areas where OpenShift Virtualization could add value.
* **Goal Alignment**: Align business and operational goals with the target solution. Define success for the organization in terms of scalability, cost-savings, and operational efficiencies.
* **Architecture Definition**: Specify the ideal architecture, detailing components such as compute requirements, network configurations, and storage options. This architecture will serve as a foundational roadmap for the next phases.

&nbsp;

### Phase 2 - Team Enablement and PoC

Educate the customerâ€™s team with foundational OpenShift Virtualization skills and setup a proof-of-concept (PoC) platform for hands-on experience.

* **OpenShift Virtualization Fundamentals**: Conduct training sessions focused on KubeVirt essentials, helping the team understand the basics of Kubernetes-based virtualization tailored to the customerâ€™s needs.
* **OpenShift Virtualization Architecture & Strategy**: Overview of how OpenShift Virtualization will fit into their infrastructure, focusing on integration points, best practices, and architectural guidelines.
* **PoC Environment Setup**: Deploy a dedicated PoC platform on the customerâ€™s preferred environment, whether on-premises or on a public cloud. This sandboxed setup allows the team to explore OpenShift Virtualization functionalities, test workload and experiment with different configurations.
* **Hands-on Training**: Scenarios that allow the team to apply what theyâ€™ve learned, exploring tasks like creating or migrating virtual machines, managing resources, and testing different configurations within the PoC.

&nbsp;

### Phase 3 - Workload Assessment and Migration Planning

Create a structured approach for workload migration, focusing on identifying high-impact workloads and developing a feasible migration plan.

* **Workload Categorization**: Work closely with the team to identify "low-hanging fruits for migration, typically workload with high impact but low complexity. All workload will be categorized based on factors like compatibility, migration effort, and expected savings.
* **Impact and Effort Analysis**: Evaluation of the potential impact on operations and the effort required for migration. This matrix helps prioritize workload and create a phased migration approach, allowing for quick wins and clear cost-benefit insights.
* **Migration Roadmap Development**: Design a migration plan that maps out the order and methodology for each workloadâ€™s transition to the OpenShift Virtualization environment. The roadmap includes timelines, resource requirements, risk assessments, and fallback options to ensure a smooth migration.
* **Next Steps Consultation**: Wrap up the engagement with a strategic review, including suggested next steps, ongoing support options, and a high-level plan for full-scale deployment.
