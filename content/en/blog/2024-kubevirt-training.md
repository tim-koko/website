We are convinced of the technology's potential, find the Kubernetes API-first approach particularly exciting and believe that KubeVirt can enable significant cost savings both in terms of licensing and infrastructure. Additionally, KubeVirt lays the foundation for the unification and optimization of operational processes.

For these reasons, we have spent the past few months working closely with our partner [acend](https://acend.ch/trainings/kubevirt/) to develop a comprehensive two-day training.

### What is KubeVirt?

KubeVirt is an extension of Kubernetes that follows the Operator pattern. Originally launched by Red Hat in 2016, KubeVirt has been available as open source software since 2017. KubeVirt was then accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and reached the Incubating maturity level in 2022, highlighting its significance in the cloud-native ecosystem.

KubeVirt enables the operation of traditional virtual machines (VMs) alongside container workload on the same infrastructure. Its full potential is unfolded when deployed directly on bare metal environments.

<br/><br/>

The acquisition of VMware by Broadcom has prompted many organizations running their workload on traditional virtualization solutions to intensify their search for alternatives. A transition to **KubeVirt** or **OpenShift Virtualization** is often seen as an opportunity to reduce costs, minimize vendor lock-in, standardize processes and adopt open standards.

#### Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

We offer the training in both pure **KubeVirt** and the **OpenShift Virtualization** variants.

The KubeVirt project was initiated by Red Hat and continues to be actively developed by them. Red Hat provides this technology under the name Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, which is part of the Red Hat OpenShift product.

### Content

The training combines engaging presentations with hands-on labs to effectively convey the material.

During the two-day training, we will explore the following topics:

* Introduction to KubeVirt concepts and architecture
* Deploying and managing virtual machines
* Comparison with typical Kubernetes workload
* VM images
* Storage
* Networking
* Operations and lifecycle
* Workload and live migration

As part of the acend training, we'll wrap up with an aperitif to reinforce what we've learned and share our experiences.

#### Training objectives

* Introduction to the KubeVirt technology
* Understanding the technology's fundamental concepts and architecture
* Deploying and configuring VMs using KubeVirt
* Exploring integration possibilities between containers and VMs

### Target audience

Our training is aimed at individuals who already have knowledge in the area of containers and container platforms and are familiar with the basic concepts of virtual machines.

Participants will need a laptop with direct internet access.

We are happy to answer any questions you may have. You can reach us best at [hallo@tim-koko.ch](mailto:hallo@tim-koko.ch)&nbsp;or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tim-koko). You can find the exact details of the training on [acend's website](https://acend.ch/trainings/kubevirt/).

If you want to know even more, we will share our experiences with the community at the following meetup:

* 28.11.2024 - 16:00: [Cloud Native Switzerland Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/cloud-native-computing-switzerland/events/302784454) in Lucerne

We also offer you the following opportunities to learn more about KubeVirt or OpenShift Virtualization:

* [tim&koko labs](https://tim-koko.ch/en/labs/): Get to know the basics of KubeVirt in one afternoon and apply them directly in practical hands-on labs.
* [KubeVirt Basics Training](https://acend.ch/en/trainings/kubevirt/): Two-day varied training with presentations and hands-on labs.
* [OpenShift Virtualization Accelerator Package](https://tim-koko.ch/en/services/openshift-virtualization-accelerator/): We help you explore the possibilities of OpenShift Virtualization and find out how high the potential for a new or parallel strategy could be.
