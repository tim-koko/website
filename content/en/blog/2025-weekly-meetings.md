### Why do we do weekly syncs at tim&koko?

It's simple: a regular exchange promotes a sense of togetherness, creates a connection between members and helps to share knowledge. You can learn from each other, solve problems together and, of course, celebrate successes. It's not just about working through tasks, but also about team spirit.

### What does our Weekly currently look like?

Our Weekly consists of a few simple but effective elements that ensure it doesn't get boring and continues to offer added value for everyone:

1. **Update on who is working on what**\
   A brief overview of who is currently working on which project or task. This helps to keep an eye on progress and identify any bottlenecks at an early stage.
1. **Go through tasks with an upcoming due date**\
   Here we focus on tasks that should be completed soon. It's a pragmatic way to keep track and ensure that important deadlines are met.
1. **Request help**\
   If someone needs support, the Weekly is the opportunity to bring this up. This allows the team to find solutions together.
1. **Short, pragmatic protocol**\
   Yes, it sounds old-school, but protocols ensure that everyone - even those who are not present - can follow the progress of the meeting. This is not only practical, but also promotes transparency within the team.
1. **Update on planning**\
   A quick look at the general planning helps us to keep an eye on the next steps and ensure that we are on the right course as a team.
1. **Speak up - but in the right way!**\
   Sometimes things need to get out. But we pay attention to whether someone just wants to let off steam or really needs help. This difference is crucial to keeping a meeting productive.
1. **Rotate the meeting leader**\
   To create variety and keep the Weekly interesting, we rotate the leadership of the meeting. This gives everyone the opportunity to take on responsibility and bring a breath of fresh air to the meeting.
1. **Lunch together for those present on site**\
   After the weekly meeting, we often sit down together for lunch. It gives us space to talk and strengthens team spirit.

A weekly can be more than just working through to-do lists. It's about promoting exchange, awakening creativity and breaking out of the routine from time to time. With small adjustments in between, you can make your Weekly not only more effective, but also more interesting - for you and your team.

So why not try a small change and see what positive effect it has on your everyday life?
