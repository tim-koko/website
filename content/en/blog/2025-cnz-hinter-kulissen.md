lead: "Hard to believe it’s already been four months since we gathered at the Abaton in Zurich – for inspiring talks, thought-provoking discussions, and a relaxed aperitif on the rooftop terrace of SOHO. [Cloud Native Zurich (CNZ)](https://cloudnativezurich.ch/) remains a day full of energy, knowledge sharing, and community spirit in our memories."

But what really goes on behind the scenes of such an event? Who are the people working tirelessly for months to ensure everything runs smoothly and the day becomes an inspiring experience?

## Preparations Start Early

While many of us are still reflecting on the last CNZ, Thömu, Phil, and Milena – the organizing trio behind the event – are already deep into preparations for the upcoming year. Because: after one event is before the next.
In a weekly call, they discuss current to-dos, prepare the Call for Papers, align on the speaker selection, and keep track of the big picture. The Call for Papers officially runs from January to March, allowing the team to finalize the program in spring and ensure technical coordination is well underway in time.
But there’s much more to be done before the dress rehearsal and the big day in June. That’s why the three have clearly divided responsibilities – teamwork at its finest:

### Who Does What?

**Phil** is our numbers guy and the behind-the-scenes mastermind. He not only ensures the event is financially viable but also manages close relationships with sponsors, organizes the speaker event, and coordinates with the venue and catering – in short, he makes sure the Cloud Native Day can actually take place.

**Milena** is the voice to the outside world. She is responsible for all marketing and communication, plans the social media campaigns, and oversees the event’s visual identity. From the first Instagram post to the final roll-up banner – Milena makes sure CNZ is visible and recognizable. She also coordinates designers, video production, and all promotional materials.

**Thömu** is the content lead of the event. He curates the Call for Papers, selects the speakers together with the team, and builds the program around them. He also plans the entire event schedule – who needs to be where and when, what tech is needed, and how sessions are coordinated. His experience ensures everything runs like clockwork.

## The Big Day

The importance of structured preparation and a well-coordinated team becomes most evident on event day. The last few days before CNZ are traditionally a bit hectic – unexpected challenges, last-minute changes, growing nerves. But this is exactly when clear roles and mutual trust pay off.
Phil continues managing sponsor relations, Milena handles communications and ensures a consistent presence across all channels, and Thömu makes sure the sessions run smoothly, supporting the speakers and helping them feel at ease. After all, great talks don’t just come from expertise – they also come from feeling appreciated and supported on stage.

### The Team Behind the Team

Of course, Thömu, Phil, and Milena couldn’t do it alone – an event like CNZ thrives on the support of many helping hands. From the tech crew and the catering team to the on-site helpers, our tim&koko crew, and the multimedia producers: CNZ wouldn’t be possible without them. And let’s not forget our sponsors – not only do they support the event financially, but they also enrich it with their booths, giveaways, and technical insights.

### Ein Tag für die Community - von der Community

Yes, it’s a lot of work. And yes, sometimes it’s a little chaotic. But what remains is a strong sense of connection, inspiration, and joy. The Cloud Native Day Zurich is more than just a tech event – it’s a platform for exchange, innovation, and true community.
We’re proud to be part of this journey – and we’re already looking forward to the next CNZ!
