That's exactly what we did at tim&koko during a three-day workshop full of insights, team spirit, fun and growth.

### The path is the goal

Our journey began with a hike from Sunnbüel towards Hotel Schwarenbach, where we mastered our first team task. This
experience showed us how important it is to become aware of our own strengths and to recognize how others perceive
these strengths. This not only increases motivation and self-confidence, but also the connection within the team.

### Values that unite

A common foundation is based on personal values and their alignment with company values. Which values should be lived
more in the team and where can each individual contribute to ensuring that these values are present in everyday life?
At tim&koko, we were happy to see how many of our personal values are in line with the company values. This makes us
look forward to moving in the same direction together.

### Visions for the future

Another key focus of our workshop was on what activities we would like to devote ourselves to in the future and how we
can shape our internal organization.

What do we enjoy in our day-to-day work? How do we complement each other as a team and what could enrich our portfolio
in the coming years? These questions led to valuable insights.

Finally, we defined our common drive and purpose: what do we believe in, why ist tim&koko needed, and why do we do what
we do?

### A finish with a view

We concluded the second day of the workshop with a tim&koko future beer to toast our vision for 2029. We watched marmots
and refreshed ourselves in the cool mountain lake.

On the last day, we continued our hike to Gemmi and were rewarded for our ascent with a breathtaking view and delicious
food.

This workshop not only strengthened us as a team, but also sharpened our focus on the future together. We are ready to
realize our vision with full energy and united forces!
