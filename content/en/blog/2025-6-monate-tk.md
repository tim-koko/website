### The First Weeks

On my very first day, I was welcomed with coffee and croissants. Sarah took the time to introduce me to all the essentials, and during my first week, Livia walked me through my tasks and prepared me thoroughly for the months ahead – before heading off on a well-deserved parental leave.
Thankfully, she not only explained everything clearly but also documented many of the processes, which I could always refer back to whenever I was unsure about something.
Of course, the rest of the team was also incredibly helpful and patiently answered all my questions. Coming from a completely different industry, terms like Kubernetes, OpenShift Virtualization, or KubeVirt were just buzzwords at first. ChatGPT wasn’t much help – but Chrigu managed to clarify things with a clever IKEA analogy. That was a real lightbulb moment!

### The tim&koko Lifestyle

When I joined, we were seven people – though due to parental leave and remote work, usually just four of us were in the office. Still, thanks to the warm welcome and how quickly I was integrated into the team, I felt part of it right away.
Our team day every Thursday is especially important: we always make time to eat lunch together, catch up, and recharge – sometimes with a spontaneous "Fübi". These rituals bring the team closer and make work even more enjoyable.

### tim&koko as an Employer

tim&koko has grown out of the early startup phase, having learned what works and what doesn’t – but it's still far from being a rigid, traditional company. Processes are questioned, new ideas are welcome, and critical thinking is encouraged.
What I appreciate most: tim&koko isn’t just generous – the company truly cares about the well-being of every team member.
If you’re eager to become part of our team, you’re in luck! We’re currently looking for someone who’s excited to work on exciting projects with Kubernetes, container technologies, CI/CD, messaging, and more. You can find the job posting here: https://tim-koko.ch/jobs/

### Mein Fazit

From day one, I’ve felt right at home – and I know that my work is truly appreciated. Initially, I joined to temporarily cover for Livia during her parental leave. But since she’s now fully enjoying life as a new parent, I’ve been given the chance to stay on as part of the team – and I’m very happy about that!
Since workload hasn’t always been consistent in recent months, I’ll now be focusing on the back office one day a week. Which works out perfectly – because I’m planning to spend autumn and winter on the other side of the world. More on that... maybe in a future post.
