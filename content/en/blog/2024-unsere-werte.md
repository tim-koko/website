## Authenticity and quality - our aspiration

For us, authenticity means being honest and transparent, within the team, towards our customers and partners. We stand by what we do and are committed to ensuring that our work remains transparent. This attitude is the basis for the quality that we bring to our projects. With care and a clear eye for detail, we strive for the best possible result.

## Strong together - teamwork as the basis

For us, success is a team effort. We believe that cooperation is based on trust, respect and mutual support. Everyone can contribute their strengths, and that is what makes us strong as a team. Whether in our daily interactions or in our work with customers - we work together to find sustainable solutions.

In our work, we value openness and collaboration, and this extends to the technologies we use. We are committed to ensuring that these align with the open-source spirit, remaining accessible and adaptable for everyone.

## Professionalism and commitment

For us, professionalism means that we work in a reliable and structured manner. But it's about more than that: we are fully committed to our goals. We are not satisfied with the bare minimum, but are always looking for ways to develop and improve. Reflecting on our work helps us not to stand still.

## Fun and enthusiasm - Enjoying our work

Even though we work in a professional and goal-oriented manner, it is important to us that fun is not neglected. Real creativity can only arise when work is fun. Our enthusiasm motivates us to tackle projects with passion, and this enthusiasm is also felt by our customers and partners.

## Optimism and sustainability - looking to the future

We are optimistic and see challenges as opportunities. It is important to us to think long-term. For us, sustainability means making decisions in such a way that they have a positive and lasting impact - for our team, our customers and the environment.

## Ambitious and open to new ideas

We set ourselves ambitious goals and remain open to change. For us, a pioneering spirit means breaking new ground and not shying away from risks. We know that innovation and progress only come about through curiosity and courage.

## Conclusion: Our values as a compass

Our values are the guiding principles that guide us in our daily work. They combine authenticity, quality, teamwork and commitment with a clear focus on the future. With fun and enthusiasm, we are committed to sustainable and innovative solutions that help both us and our customers move forward.
