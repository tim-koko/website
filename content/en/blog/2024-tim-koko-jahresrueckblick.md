### Our growing team

We are now six motivated people at tim&koko. Each individual brings unique strengths, creativity and passion. We work
together to offer our customers the best solutions.

### Renaming to tim&koko

One of the biggest milestones was our [renaming](https://tim-koko.ch/en/blog/neuer-brand-name/). Our old name became tim&koko - a fresh, clear expression of who we are
and what we stand for. Our name tim&koko honors the British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World
Wide Web, as well as the female gorilla Koko, who communicated in sign language. The name stands for technological
solutions and communication at eye level - just like our way of working.

### Summer workshop

In the summer, we came together to learn, brainstorm and develop as a team. Creative approaches, new ideas and plenty
of team spirit characterized this workshop. It was an inspiring moment that brought us closer together. During the three
days of the [workshop](https://tim-koko.ch/en/blog/tim-koko-sommerworkshop/), we strengthened our team spirit, reflected
on the alignment of personal and company values as a basis for a common direction and developed a clear vision for our
future and our internal organization.

### Customer event in october

Our office was transformed into a lively meeting place in October. At the customer event, we were able to have exciting
conversations, exchange ideas and toast to our collaboration. We would like to thank everyone who took part and made the
event a success!

### Baloise Codecamp

Technology and community took center stage at the Baloise Codecamp. Here we were able to network with like-minded people,
share knowledge and be inspired by new approaches. An event that showed us how much power there is in a community.

### Puzzle /mid - tim&koko after-work beer

Even before the official announcement of our partnership with Puzzle in December, we celebrated the collaboration in
style - with pizza and a relaxed after-work beer. Together, we are pooling our strengths to develop the best solutions
for our customers: with bundled expertise, customized strategies and additional power for innovative projects.

### Focus topic KubeVirt

A major topic for us in 2024 was virtualization in the cloud - specifically: OpenShift Virtualization / KubeVirt. We
shared our expertise in blog posts on our website and are delighted that this topic was so well received. For anyone
who hasn't read it yet: Be sure to check out our blog or sign up directly for our free hands-on labs: [https://tim-koko.ch/en/labs](https://tim-koko.ch/en/labs)

### Thank you for a great year!

None of these milestones would have been possible without our customers and partners. You are the reason why we do what
we do - and why we love it.

2025 is just around the corner, and we look forward to working with you to realize more exciting projects, develop new
ideas and continue to grow as a team.

Thank you for your support and trust - we can't wait to write the next chapter with you!

Your tim&koko team
