### Our Name, Our Philosophy

The name tim&koko wasn’t chosen by chance. It’s inspired by the female gorilla Koko, who famously learned to communicate using sign language, demonstrating just how powerful and connective language can be. This kind of connection is what we strive for – not just technically. For us, communication on equal footing is more than just a marketing promise – it’s part of our everyday work.

### Tech Languages? Check. Human Languages? Also Check!

In the tech world, we’re fluent in many “languages” and of course English – the lingua franca of the IT world. And as a company based in Bern, we also speak Swiss German – and yes, even High German when necessary. 😉
But there’s more. We’re fascinated by languages not just in our work, but in our private lives as well. As a team, we speak a total of ten different languages.

Admittedly, apart from Sarah, who once lived and worked in Geneva, our French is a bit rusty, but we still manage – at the very least, we can always order a beer.

### Dutch, Swedish, Italian, Greek, Spanish, and Indonesian

- **Dutch:** Sarah is the only one on our team who grew up with a “bonus language.” Thanks to her family, she’s been fluent in Dutch since childhood.

- **Swedish:** Livia fell in love with the language while kitesurfing in Sweden. Since then, she’s been watching Swedish series to keep the melody of the language in her mind – perfect for her next trip to Scandinavia.

- **Italian and Greek:** Thömu expands our language portfolio by two more. Before starting his studies, he spent a few months in Tropea, where he picked up Italian – the perfect language for la dolce vita. Thanks to a past Greek romance, he also learned a bit of Greek – for the full linguistic mix.

- **Spanish:** Marie perfected her Spanish while working in an animal shelter in Mexico. After over a year in Latin America and regular Spanish courses in Switzerland and Spain, conversations are no problem for her anymore.

- **Indonesian:** Chrigu wanted something a bit more exotic, so he chose Indonesian. Twice a week, he and his partner attend a language course organized by the Indonesian embassy. And with a planned vacation in Indonesia on the horizon, he’s got the perfect motivation boost.
