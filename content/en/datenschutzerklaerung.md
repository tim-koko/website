## 4. Data Transfer and Data Transmission

We only pass on your data to third parties if this is necessary for the provision of our services, if these third parties provide a service for us, if we are obliged to do so by law or by official order, if we have an overriding interest in the disclosure of the personal data, or if you have given us your consent or requested us to do so.

We conclude contracts with service providers who process personal data on our behalf, obliging them to guarantee data protection. Most of our service providers are located in Switzerland or the EU / EEA. Should a data transfer to other countries that do not have an adequate level of data protection be necessary, this will be done on the basis of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or other suitable instruments.

## 5. Retention Period of Personal Data

We process and store your personal data as long as it is necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual and legal obligations or otherwise for the purposes pursued with the processing, i.e., for the duration of the entire business relationship (from initiation and processing to the termination of a contract) as well as beyond that in accordance with statutory retention and documentation obligations. We retain personal data for the period during which claims can be asserted against our company (during the statutory limitation period) and insofar as we are otherwise legally obliged to do so or legitimate business interests require it (e.g., for evidence and documentation purposes). As soon as your personal data is no longer required for the above-mentioned purposes, it will be deleted or anonymized as far as possible in principle.

## 6. Data Security

We will keep your data secure and take all reasonable measures to protect your data from loss, access, misuse, or alteration.
Our employees and all contractual partners who have access to your data are obliged to comply with data protection regulations.
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs, and the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
Measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transfer, and ensuring the availability of the data and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we consider the protection of personal data already during the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through privacy by design and through privacy-friendly default settings.

## 8. Social Media

We are present on social media platforms and other online platforms to communicate with interested persons and to inform them about us and our offers. In this context, personal data may also be processed outside of Switzerland and the European Economic Area (EEA).

In the event of a violation of the rules of decency and conduct, we may also report the relevant user account to the provider of the platform for blocking or deletion.
When you visit our social media pages, data (e.g., about your user behavior) may also be transmitted directly to the respective provider or collected by them and processed together with other data already known to the provider (e.g., for marketing and market research purposes and for personalizing platform content). If we are jointly responsible with the provider for certain processing, we conclude a corresponding agreement with the provider, the essential content of which you can find out from the provider. Further information on data processing by the providers of social networks can be found in the privacy policies of the respective social networks.
In addition, the General Terms and Conditions (GTC) and Terms of Use as well as the privacy policies and other provisions of the individual operators of such online platforms apply.
