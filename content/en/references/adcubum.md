tim&koko is supporting Adcubum on their exciting journey into the cloud. We take on the important roles of product owner of a system team and cloud architect in the Kubernetes journey, which aims to prepare Syrius for operation on OpenShift. Additionally, we help with the engineering of a central tracing platform.

Martina Penz, Projectmanager: *«Thomas Philipona has successfully advised and actively supported us in our journey to the cloud, in the roles as Product Owner and Architect. Thanks to his proven expertise and extensive experience, we were able to identify potential risks early on and navigate obstacles. Thömu quickly familiarized himself with our highly complex software environment and seamlessly integrated into our agile team structure. The trustful collaboration with him not only generates value but also brings a lot of enjoyment due to his open and positive nature.»*
